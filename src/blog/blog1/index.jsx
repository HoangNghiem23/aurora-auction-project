          <h3>Emily Xie</h3>
          <p>
            Emily Xie, an artist with a lifelong passion for both art and computers, began her artistic journey experimenting with traditional methods. She pursued formal education at Harvard, earning degrees in history of art and architecture, as well as computational science and engineering. Initially, she worked as a software engineer but discovered her love for generative art around 2015, which she pursued alongside her job. Xie's career took off when she became an artist-in-residence at Pioneer Works, an artist and scientist-led nonprofit cultural center in Red Hook, Brooklyn that fosters innovative thinking through the visual and performing arts, technology, music, and science, in 2016. Her very recognizable style and techniques push the boundaries of generative and her numerous public collections have made her a well-known artist. She has also collaborated with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).
